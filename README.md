5.Insert file links into index.html

##Bootstrap

+Dist folder - everything that will be used on the website goes here
+Src folder - minified version

##Jquery
npm install jquery - needs to add jquery when using bootstrap, don't forget to add jquery link before bootstrap because bootstrap is all written in jquery
